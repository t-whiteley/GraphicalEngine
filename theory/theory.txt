Theory

OBJECT SPACE
 - design all shapes in the scenes through a list of meshes
 - each shape in a mesh / its own coordinate system centered at 0
 - properties of the mesh are world view coordinates and directions

WORLD SPACE
 - iterate over all meshes in their respective object spaces and apply rotation/translation transforms for world space

CAMERA SPACE
 - by applying the transformations that would move camera to origin and directed at -ve z axis, apply the inverse of this transform to every object for camera space
 - camera wanted at the center of its space because it simplifies the following transforms that need to be applied
